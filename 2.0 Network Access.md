# 2.0 Network Access
## 2.1 Configure and verify VLANs (normal range) spanning multiple switches
#### Understanding VLANS
A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a grouping of devices on one or more physical LANs that can communicate as if they were on the same physical LAN, even if they are geographically dispersed. VLANs are used to segment a network into smaller, isolated segments to improve performance, enhance security, and simplify management. VLANs are often associated with IP subnetworks.
VLAN Membership Policy Server (VMPS) is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to dynamically assign VLANs to devices based on their MAC addresses. VMPS simplifies VLAN management in large networks by centralizing VLAN assignment policies.
- Normal-Range VLANs (IDs 1 to 1005)
- Extended-Range VLANs (IDs 1006 to 4094)
    - 1002 through 1005 are reserved for Token Ring and FDDI VLANs
- VLAN Membership Policy Server (VMPS)
- A switch can route traffic between VLANs by using switch virtual interfaces (SVIs).

The switch supports per-VLAN spanning-tree plus (PVST+) or rapid PVST+ with a maximum of 128 spanning-tree instances. One spanning-tree instance is allowed per VLAN.
Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) allows multiple VLANs to be mapped to a single spanning-tree instance call MST instance (MSTI). 
- Spanning-tree refers to the creation of a loop-free logical topology 

A trunk is a network link that carries traffic for multiple VLANs across network devices, such as switches and routers. Trunks allow VLANs to span multiple switches, enabling devices in the same VLAN but on different switches to communicate with each other.
VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) is a data link layer 2 messaging protocol that maintains VLAN configuration consistency by managing the addition, deletion, and renaming of VLANs on a network-wide basis. VTP minimizes misconfigurations and configuration inconsistencies that can cause several problems, such as duplicate VLAN names, incorrect VLAN-type specifications, and security violations.
- Designed to make updates easy where if one switch is updated and are sent to the other switches in the domain.

#### Configuring Normal-Range VLANS
If the switch is in VTP server, you can add, modify, or remove configurations for VLANs 2 to 1001 in VLAN database. (VLAN IDs 1 and 1002 to 1005 are automatically created and cannot be removed.)

In VTP versions 1 and 2, the switch must be in VTP transparent mode when you create extended-range VLANs (VLANs with IDs from 1006 to 4094), but these VLANs are not saved in the VLAN database. VTP version 3 supports extended-range VLANs in VTP server and transparent mode.
- written to file "vlan.dat" (VLAN database), and you can display them by entering the "show vlan" privileged EXEC command. The vlan.dat file is stored in flash memory.
- show running-config privileged EXEC command displays...
  - VLAN ID
  - VLAN name
  - VLAN type (Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data Interface [FDDI], FDDI network entity title [NET], TrBRF, or TrCRF, Token Ring, Token Ring-Net)
  - VLAN state (active or suspended)
  - Maximum transmission unit (MTU) for the VLAN
  - Security Association Identifier (SAID)
  - Bridge identification number for TrBRF VLANs
  - Ring number for FDDI and TrCRF VLANs
  - Parent VLAN number for TrCRF VLANs
  - Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) type for TrCRF VLANs
  - VLAN number to use when translating from one VLAN type to another
