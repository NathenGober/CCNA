# 1.0 Network Fundamentals
## 1.1 Explain the role and function of network components 
### 1.1a Routers
Routers connect networks to other networks over the internet. Routers facilitate communication between different networks. Routers connect networks, route data packets between them, enforce security policies, optimize traffic flow, and provide various other critical functions to ensure efficient and reliable communication across interconnected networks.

A router performs its function almost solely at the OSI Layer 3 because the router is used to connect Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Since IP is a protocol that runs at OSI Layer 3 and can operate on multiple Layer 1 and 2 technologies, a router is typically used to connect geographically dispersed parts of a network that use technologies over than Ethernet to connect them. For example...
- Leased Line: dedicated or uncontended fixed-bandwidth connection that offers symmetrical download and upload speeds. Leased line provides exclusive use for a single business
- Frame Relay: packet-switching network protocol that operates at the data link layer 2. Itâ€™s designed to connect Local Area Networks (LANs) across Wide Area Networks (WANs).
- Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): routing technique that directs data from one node to the next based on labels. These labels represent established paths between endpoints.
Routers also provide the ability to separate IP broadcast domains... important as some protocols use broadcast heavily to communicate with hosts.

On most modern networks, multilayer switches are preferred over routers in LAN situations, and routers are used to connect together devices that don't connect using Ethernet.

Modern routers supports a number of features not limited to OSI Network Layer 3:
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Firewalling services
- Access Control Lists (ACL)
- Packet Inspection

### 1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switches
A hub is a simple device that connects together multiple  local area network (LAN) devices. The only function of the hub is repeating the electrical signels received on one port, relaying those signals to all other connected ports. Hubs are extinct for the most part in modern networks because they aren't much cheaper than switches. Hubs work at OSI Layer 1.

A bridge is used to connect multiple LAN segments together forming multiple collision domains. A collision happens on an Ethernet network when multiple devices attempt to "speak" at the same time. By separating two or more LAN segments into multiple collision domains, the bridge reduces the number of collisions that could potentially occur on a LAN segment. 

A switch connects things like computers, printers, and other devices together through a local network. A switch is a multiport bridge with some additional functionality. The switch almost completely ended the rish of collisions on hub-centered networks. 

A few categories of switches include:
- Unmanaged (Layer 2) switch
- Managed (Layer 2) switch
- Managed Layer 3 switch (multilayer switch)

Layer 2 switches primarily operate at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, focusing on MAC addresses and Ethernet frames. They are essential for LAN connectivity, MAC address learning, and VLAN support.

Unmanaged Layer 2 Switches
- An unmanaged switch provides the functionality of a multiport bridge; each of the switch ports is on its own collision domain. The switch has built-in Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which provides loop prevention when multiple switches are connected. A switch also keeps an internal database of the known MAC addresses connected to each port.
    - Used to reduce the amount of ethernet frame flooding that occurs when a device is location is unknown.

Managed Layer 2 Switches
- A managed switch provides all functionality of an unmanaged switch, and it can control and configure the behavior of the device. This typically introduces the ability to support virtual LANs (VLANs), which is why almost all organizations deploy managed switches versus their cheaper alternatives.

Layer 3 switches operate at both the Data Link layer (Layer 2) and the Network layer (Layer 3). They provide additional functionality such as IP routing, inter-VLAN routing, and support for routing protocols. Layer 3 switches are more versatile and suitable for larger networks requiring routing capabilities.

Managed Layer 3 Switches (Multilayer Switches)
- This device provides a mix of functionality between a managed layer 2 switch and a router. The amount of router function overlap is highly dependent on the switch model. A multilayer switch provides better performance for LAN routing than almost any standard router on the market because these switches are designed to offload a lot of this functionality onto hardware.

### 1.1.c Next-generation firewalls and IPS
Next-generation firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical for modern network security.

The function of a firewall is to protect some portion of a network. Techniques to do this include... access control lists (ACL), stateful packet inspection (SPI), and others. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) include all the functionality of a traditional firewall (ACL, SPI) and add support for built-in intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and virtual private networks (VPNs), as well as a much higher level of application awareness.

- Application Awareness & Control
- Integrated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- Advanced Threat Protection
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) Inspection: inspect encrypted traffic by decrypting SSL/TLS connections; protocol that allows computer systems to communicate safely over the internet
- User Identity Awarenes
- Content Filtering and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Threat Intelligence Integration

Content Filters
- Content Filters are used on some networks to control the type of data that is allowed to pass through the network. These devices can scan for and remove content that is not wanted. This functionality is typically built into modern firewalls and some routing platforms.

Intrusion Preventing System (IPS) is focused on detecting and preventing network threats in real-time. It is designed to monitor network traffic and take immediate action to block or mitigate malicious activity. 

Host Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (HIDS/HIPS)
HIDS/HIPS is used to protect a single host from an intrusion attempt. An IDS differs from an IPS in that an IDS only detects that someone is attacking; it doesn't mitigate the attack, whereas an IPS can actively mitigate the attack as it happens. 
- Modern versions of these types of software are focused mostly on intrusion prevention, because most modern-day attacks come with little or no warning and require an accelerated response.

Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS)
NIDS/NIPS is different from a HIDS/HIPS system in that it detects or prevents attacks from happening against a group of devices. Similar to their host-based alternatives, NIDS detect attacks as they're happening and report the activity, and NIPS detect and actively take steps to prevent the attack from continuing. 
- Can include everything from dynamic creation of ACLS to shutting down offending ports

- Traffic Monitoring and Analysis
- Threat Detection and Prevention
- Signature-Based Detection
- Anomaly-Based Detection
- Protocol Analysis
- Integration with Security Ecosystem

NGFWs and IPS work together to provide layered security. NGFWs may handle application control, SSL inspection, and basic IPS functions, while dedicated IPS devices can provide deeper inspection and more granular control over network traffic.

Packet Shapers/Policers 
- Controls the flow of information into or out of a specific device. The shaping or policing functionality is typically built into routers (some switches) to deal with times when network demand outpaces the ability of a device or its port. In situations of no congestion, the shaping and/or policing functionality is not used. When there is congestion, these features will control how the excessive traffic is handled.

Traffic Shapers utilize congestion functionality built into the used protocols like IP, Frame Relay, and MPLS support marking packets with varying level of priority bits; this marking affects how the traffic is treated when it's being forwarded through the network.

Traffic policers drop any traffic that exceeds a configured threshold. 

### 1.1.d Access points
An access point (AP) is used in wireless Ethernet networks in place of an ethernet switch. Typical APs also provide bridging functionality between wired and wireless ethernet hosts. Access points (APs) enable devices to connect to a network wirelessly, providing mobility and flexibility for users usually in wireless local area networks (WLANs).

Three categories of access points include...
- Consumer APs ("Can be called wireless routers in your home")
    - Consumer APs have a WAN port for connection to an ISP (Internet Service Provider); this is another ethernet port separated in the device's configuration for routing between a local network and remote network (typically Internet). This is often used as a zone separator for the built-in firewall.
- Enterprise Automonous AP
    - Acts as a bridge between the wireless clients on a network and the wired network. These devices may be managed remotely, but the services delivered are all handled with the AP itself.
- Enterprise Lightweight AP
    - Bridges wireless and wired networks, but it is controlled by a remote controller. The lightweight AP is a brainless device without the wireless controller that controls its actions and configuration. The controller can perform load balancing between APs, interference detection and mitigation, and security functionality.

- Cause: Errors can occur due to physical layer issues like cable faults, electrocmagnetic interference, or hardware problems.
- Impact: Errors degrade network performance and reliability.
- Indicators:
    - CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) errors
    - Input/output errors
    - Frame check sequence (FCS) error
 
Duplex Mismatch
- Definition: Duplex mismatch occurs when two connected devices have different duplex settings (one device is set to full-duplex while the other is set to half-duplex).
- Causes: Misconfiguration of duplex settings on one or both ends of the link.
- Impact: Leads to collisions and performance degradation, especially in full-duplex devices receiving half-duplex transmissions.
- Indicators:
    - FCS errors
    - Late collisions
    - Slow network performance compared to expected bandwidth

The mostly likely cause for a lot of collisions and runts on the infereface is because of a duplex mismatch. A duplex mismatch will not only cause end user to experience network slowness but also cause many collisions and runts on the switch interface.

When there are a lot of collisions and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) errors on the interface, there can be several problems
- Bad network cable
- Damaged Media
- Electromagnetic Interfernece (EMI)
    - Problem with the network cable attached to the port or outside interference

Speed Mismatch 
- Definition: Speed mismatch occurs when two connected devices operate at different data transmission rates (Ex. one device operates at 100 Mbps while the other operates at 1 Gbps)
- Causes: Configuration mismatch or hardware limitations.
- Impact: Packet loss, errors, and performance issues due to the inability of the slower device to handle incoming data at the faster rate.
- Indicators:
    - Interface flapping (interface goes up and down repeatedly)
    - Performance significantly lower than expected for the configured speed
 
Full Duplex Transmission
- Full duplex transmission is achieved by setting switch interfaces, router ports, and host NICs to full duplex. Microsegmentation, where each network device has its own dedicated segment to the switch, ensures full duplex will work. The device can send and receive at the same time, effectively doubling the amount of bandwidth between nodes.
    Three points to remember
    - There are no collisions in full-duplex mode.
    - A dedicated switch port is required for each full-duplex node.
    - The host network card and the switch port must be capable of operating in full-duplex mode.
    Use Cases:
    - Switched Enternet Networks
    - Telecommunications
    - Wi-Fi
    - Fiber Optic Communication

Note - By enabling Full-Duplex on a port, you are disabling Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) on a segment.
Replacing a Hub with a switch affects the CSMA/CD behavior because each switch port is a separate collision domain. One device per switch port configured for full-duplex operation elimnates collosions and the need for CSMA/CD.

Half Duplex Transmission
- Half duplex transmission is a moade of communication where data transmission can occur in both directions between two devices, but not simultaneously.
    Characteristics:
    - Alternating two-way communication
    - Reduced efficiency compared to Full Duplex
    - Potential for Collisions
    Use Cases:
    - Walkie-Talkies
    - Legacy Ethernet Networks
    - Two-Way Radio Commnication

What command allows you to view the duplex and speed settings configured for a switch port?
- To view the duplex and speed setting configured for a switch port, enter the "show interface interface-id" command as follows:
<img width="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/ff1ac3a9-db0a-4d78-b4a2-9d502ff40628">

Show interface command shows the port status is "errDisable". What are the possible causes?
- EtherChannel misconfiguration
- Duplex mismatch
- Bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) port guard has been enabled on the port
- Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD)
- A native VLAN mismatch

![image](https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/ca174edd-9135-4c57-a418-d2180f3b08bd)
What are the possibilities for this problem?
- The switch port is receiving a lot of collisions. The problem can be duplex mismatch or faulty port, or the distance between the two switches might exceed the cable specifications
    - Note - Duplex mismatch occur when the connecting ends are set to different duplex modes, or when one end's duplex is configured and the other end is set to autonegotiation.

![image](https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/6bd9322e-e267-42cb-9362-016a348c7a08)
What could be the cause of the problem?
- The switch is receiving a lot of runts. Runts are frames smaller than 64 bytes with a bad frame check sequence (FCS). Bad cabling or inconsistent duplex settings usually cause runts. 

## 1.5 Compare TCP to UDP
1. Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless
- TCP:
    - Connection-Oriented: Establishes a connection before transmitting data.
    - Reliable: Provides error-checking, acknowledgement of data receipt, and retransmission of lost packets.
    - Handshaking: Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) for connection establishment
    - Example Applications: HTTP (web browsing) , FTP (file transfer), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol; email)
- UDP:
    - Connectionless: Does not establish a connection before sending data.
    - Unreliable: No guarantee of delivery, acknowledgement, or error-checking.
    - Fast Transmission: Minimal overhead, suitable for real-time applications.
    - Example Applications: DNS (Domain Name System), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), VoIP (Voice over IP), streaming media
 
2. Header Overhead
- TCP:
      - Header Size: Larger header (20 bytes min) due to additional fields like sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, window size, etc.
      - Overhead: Higher overhead compared to UDP
- UDP:
    - Header Size: Smaller header (8 bytes) with miminal fields (source port, destination port, length, checksum)
    - Efficiency: Lower overhead makes it faster and more efficient for transmitting small amounts of data
 
3. Reliability & Ordering
- TCP:
    - Reliability: Reliable delivery of data with error detection and correction mechanisms.
    - Sequencing: Ensures data is delivered in order to the application layer.
- UDP:
    - Reliability: No guarantee of delivery or error recovery
    - Ordering: Packets may arrive out of order, and the application layer must handle sequencing if needed.

4. Use Cases
- TCP:
    - Used when reliability and ordered delivery are crucial (Ex. file transfer, web browsing, email)
- UDP:
    - Used when speed and efficiency are more important than reliability (Ex. real-time multimedia applications, online games)
    - Suitable for applications that can tolerate occasional packet loss and do not require retransmission
 
5. Flow Control & Congestion Control
- TCP:
    - Implements flow control and congestion control algorithms to manage data transmission rates and avoid network congestion
    - Adjusts transmission speed based on network conditions (Ex. TCP sliding window)
- UDP:
    - Does not implement flow or congestion control
    - Applications using UDP must manage these aspects independently

6. Examples
- TCP: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet
- UDP: DNS, DHCP, SNMP, VoIP, streaming media (Ex. UDP-based protocols like RTP for real-time applications)
    - Another example of UDP is a keyboard or controller sending inputs to an online game. 

## 1.6 Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting
IPv4 Addresses are 32-bit numerical identifiers assigned to devices on a network. They are typically represented in dotted-decimal format (Ex. 192.168.1.1) and are divided into classes:
- Class A: Range from 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 (8 bits for network, 24 bits for host)
- Class B: Range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (16 bits for network, 16 bits for host)
- Class C: Range from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (24 bits for network, 8 bits for host)

Subnetting:
Subnetting involves dividing a larger network into smaller sub-networks (subnets). It helps optimize network performance, manage IP address allocation efficiently, and enhance security. 
1. Determine Requirements:
    - Network Size: Determine the number of subnets and hosts needed for each subnet.
    - IP Address Range: Choose an appropriate IP address range based on the required number of subnets and hosts per subnet.
2. Subnet Mask Calculation
    - Subnet Mask: Defines the network portion and host portion of an IP address.
    - CIDR Notation: Represents subnet masks using the format IP_address/Prefix_Length (Ex. 192.168.1.0/24)
3. IP Address Allocation
    - Assign IP Addressses: Allocate IP addresses to devices within each subnet
    - Reserve IP Addresses: Reserve certain IP addresses for network infrastructure (Ex. routers, servers)
4. Verify IP Address Configuration
    - IP Configuration Commands: Use command-line tools like 'ipconfig' (Windows) or 'ifconfig' (Linux/Unix) to verify IP addresses on devices
    - Subnet Mask Verification: Ensure that subnet masks match the intended network segmentation

## 1.7 Describe the need for private IPv4 addressing
1. Limited IPv4 Address Space
    - IPv4 Address Exhaustion: The IPv4 address space is limited to approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. With the exponential growth of devices connected to the internet, this address space is insufficient to provide a unique public IP address to every device.
    - Conversation of Public Addresses: Private IPv4 addresses help conserve the limited pool of public IPv4 addresses by allowing organizations to use the same private IP address ranges internally.
2. Private IPv4 Address Ranges:
Defined by RFC 1918, private IPv4 addresses are not routable on the public internet and are meant for use within private networks. The private IP address ranges are:
    - Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
    - Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.32.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
    - Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
3. Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Functionality: NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet. When a device on a private network needs to communicate with a device on the public internet, NAT translates the private IP address to a public IP address.
- Types of NAT:
    - Static NAT: Maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address
    - Dynamic NAT: Maps a private IP address to a public IP address from a pool of available public addresses
    - Port Address Translation (PAT): Also known as "overloading", maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address by using different ports
4. Benefits of Private IPv4 Addressing:
- Security
    - Isolation: Devices with private IP addresses are not directly reachable from the public internet, providing an additional layer of security
    - Internal Communication: Private IP addresses facilitate secure communication within an organization's internal network
- Address Reusability
    - Local Use: Private IP address ranges can be reused in different private networks without conflict, making them ideal for internal communication
    - Cost Savings: Using private IP addresses reduces the need to purchase additional public IP addresses
- Simplified Network Management
    - Internal Organization: Easier management and organization of internal IP address schemes
    - Subnetting: Facilitates the creation of subnets within an organization, enhancing network performance and efficiency
5. Use Cases:
- Home Networks - use IP addresses to connect devices like computers, smartphones, and smart TVs to the router, which then uses NAT to connect to internet
- Corporate Networks - Businesses use private IP addresses to connect internal devices, servers, and workstations. NAT and firewall technologies help manage traffic between private network and the internet
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) - Private IP addresses are used within VPNs to provide secure, remote access to an organization's internal network resources
6. Comparison of Public & Private
- Public IP Addresses: Unique across the entire internet, assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or regional internet registries
- Private IP Addresses: Not unique across internet, used exclusively within private networks and not routable on the public internet

## 1.8 Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix
IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers represented in hexadecimal format. They are divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal deigits, separated by colons (Ex. 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). Leading zeros in each group can be omitted, and consecutive groups of zeros can be abbreviated with a double colon (::).

IPv6 Address Types (Prefix Examples)
- Global Unicast Address: Similar to public IPv4 addresses, these are globally unique and routable on the internet (Ex. 2001:0db8::/32)
- Link-Local Address: Used for communication within a single network segment (Ex. fe80::/10)
- Unique Local Address (ULA): Used for local communication within a site or organization, similar to private IPv4 addresses (Ex. fc00::/7)

Configuring IPv6 Addressing

1. Manual Configuration
You can manually assign IPv6 addresses to interfaces on network devices. Here's how to do it on a Cisco router:
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/d00bba7a-099b-4906-8d09-bbabcfa76735">

2. Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
Devices can automatically configure their own IPv6 addresses based on the network prefix advertised by routers.
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/05782bc1-cc1d-4abe-b389-7fb04c08c67c">

3. DHCPv6
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) can be used to assign IPv6 addresses dynamically.
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/d245edb1-6793-4725-9b51-60630a8e3308">

Verifying IPv6 Addressing

1. Check Interface IPv6 Configuration:
Use the 'show ipv6 interface' command to verify the IPv6 address configuration on a specific interface.
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/89d2e8f3-d9e3-4013-9820-c9bd56806d25">

2. Display IPv6 Routing Table:
The 'show ipv6 route' command displays the IPv6 routing table, which includes all known IPv6 routes.
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/040c616b-fed0-4861-8a1f-3d9954b94948">

3. Ping IPv6 Addresses:
The 'ping' command can be used to test connectivity between devices using their IPv6 addresses.
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/1d3b4244-99b8-4ed1-9109-5b6fb385c9e8">

## 1.9 Describe IPv6 address types
### 1.9.a Unicast (global, unique local, and link local)

LAN traffic is transmitted one of the following three ways:
- Unicast: Unicasts are the most common type of LAN traffic. A unicast frame is a frame intended for only one host.
- Broadcast: Broadcast frames are intended for all hosts within a broadcast domain. Stations view broadcast frames as public service announcements. All stations receive and process broadcast frames.
- Multicast: Multicasts are traffic in which one transmitter tries to reach only a subset, or group, of the entire segment.

1. Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs)
Global Unicast Addresses are unique IPv6 addresses that are routable on the global internet. They serve a similar purpose to public IPv4 addresses and are used for direct communication between devices across different networks worldwide.

Structure:
- Prefix: The global unicast address typically starts with '2000::/3' (the first three bits are '001')
- Global Routing Prefix: The initial portion of the address assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or regional registries (Ex. 2001:0db8::/32)
- Subnet ID: Defines a specific subnet within the given network (Ex. 2001:0db8:abcd::/64)
- Interface ID: The remaining portion of the address, often derived from the device's MAC address using EUI-64 format or generated randomly
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/11f5550c-15ce-4fdb-8276-2e3ff3c0f64e">

Use Cases:
- Public servers and devices that need to be accessible over the internet
- Communication between different networks across the internet

2. Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)
Unique Local Addresses in IPv6 are meant for local communication within a site or organization, similar to private IPv4 addresses. They are not routable on the global internet and are used primarily for internal networks.

Structure:
- Prefix: ULAs start with 'fc00::/7', but typically use 'fd00::/8' (the eighth bit is '1').
- Global ID: A 40-bit identifier that ensures uniqueness within an organization
- Subnet ID: Defines specific subnets within the local network
- Interface ID: The remaining portion of the address
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/07b78db1-c51f-42cd-b11a-9012310d4d9e">

Use Cases:
- Internal communications within an organization or site
- Networks that do not require external internet access
- Virtual private networks (VPNs)

3. Link-Local Addresses
Link-local addresses are used for communication within a single network segment or link. They are automatically configured on all IPv6-enabled interfaces and are essential for various network functions like neighbor discovery.

Structure:
- Prefix: Link-local addresses start with 'fe80::/10' (the first ten bits are '1111 1110 10')
- Remaining Bits: Set to zero, except for the Interface ID, which is typically derived from the device's MAC address
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/58486c34-2045-4e1d-a98a-5f08a0a28266">

Use Cases:
- Communication between devices on the same local network segment
- Essential for network discovery protocols, such as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
- Required for the operations of certain network features, like auto-configuration

Key Differences and Usage:
- Global Unicast Addresses: Used for devices needing global reachability on the internet. They are unique across the globe and routable.
- Unique Local Addresses: Used within private networks for internal communication. They are not routable on the global internet but unique within a given local scope.
- Link-Local Addresses: Used for communication within a single network segment. They are automatically assigned and essential for basic network operations.

<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/dffb0021-1ceb-4dd4-8abd-39e0960c2332">

### 1.9.b Anycast
Anycast addresses in IPv6 are used to deliver packets to the nearest or most convenient node among a group of potential receivers that share the same address. This is useful for load balancing, redundancy, and optimizing service delivery.

Characteristics:
1. One-to-Nearest Communication - The nearest node is typically determined by the routing protocol based on metrics like hop count, latency, or other criteria.
2. Shared Address - Multiple nodes can share the same anycast address. When a packet is sent to an anycast address, it is delivered to the closest node.
3. Routing-Based Delivery - Routing protocols ensure that the packet is delivered to the nearest node in terms of routing cost.

Use Cases:
- DNS Servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other services where availability and redundancy are critical

### 1.9.c Multicast
IPv6 Multicast is a method of sending network traffic to multiple destinations simultaneously. Multicast sends data only to a group of interested receivers. This is useful for applications like streaming media, video conferencing, and other types of group communication.

Characteristics:
1. Multicast Addresses:
    - Start with the prefix 'FF00::/8'. The structure of a multicast address is defined as 'FFxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx', where the first 8 bits are always '1111 1111' to indicate it's a multicast address.
    - Next 4 bits are the "flags" field, and following 4 bits indicate the scope (Ex. link-local, site-local, organization-local, global)
    - Examples of common scopes:
        - FF01:: for node-local scope
        - FF02:: for link-local scope
        - FF05:: for site-local scope
        - FF08:: for organization-local scope
        - FF0E:: for global scope
2. Multicast Groups:
    - A multicast group is a set of receivers that are interested in receiving specific data streams. Devices can join or leave multicast groups dynamically.
    - IPv6 uses the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) to manage membership in multicast groups.
3. Efficient Data Distribution:
    - Multicast is more efficient because data packets are only sent to nodes that are part of the multicast group. This conserves bandwidth and reduces network load.
4. Uses of Multicast:
    - Common applications include live video or audio streaming, IPTV, online gaming, stock ticker services, and real-time data feeds.
### 1.9.d Modified EUI 64
Modified EUI-64 is a method used to create a unique interface identifier (IID) for an IPv6 address based on a device's MAC address. This method ensures that the IID, which forms the last 64 bits of an IPv6 address, is globally unique.

Modified EUI 64 Format
1. Start with the 48-bit MAC Address
    - A MAC address is typically represented as six pairs of hexdecimal digits (Ex. '00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E')
2. Split the MAC Address
    - Divide the MAC address into two 24-bit halves: '00:1A:2B' and '3C:4D:5E'.
3. Insert the FFFE Hexadecimal Sequence:
    - Insert 'FF:FE' in the middle of the MAC address. This makes the address 64 bits long:
        - '00:1A:2B' becomes '00:1A:2B:FF:FE:3C:4D:5E'
4. Modify the Universal/Local (U/L) Bit:
    - The 7th bit of the first byte in the MAC address is known as the U/L bit. This bit indicates whether the address is universally or locally administered.
    - In the MAC address '00:1A:2B:FF:FE:3C:4D:5E', the first byte 00 in binary is 00000000.
    - Change the 7th bit (the U/L bit) from 0 to 1 to indicate that the address is globally unique. This transforms 00000000 to 00000010, which is 02 in hexadecimal.
    - The final IID is 02:1A:2B:FF:FE:3C:4D:5E.

## 1.11 Describe wireless principles
### 1.11.a Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels
Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels are channels in the Wi-Fi frequency bands that do not interfere with each other, ensuring a cleaner signal and better overall network performance. Nonoverlapping channels reduce interference, especially in environments with multiple Wi-Fi networks.

Importance of Nonoverlapping Channels
- Minimize Interference: Using nonoverlapping channels reduces the chance of interference between Wi-Fi networks, leading to more stable and faster connections.
- Improved Performance: Better channel separation helps maintain high data throughput and reduces packet loss.
- Optimal Network Design: Especially in dense environments (like apartments, offices, or public spaces), planning with nonoverlapping channels ensures better performance for all users.

2.4 GHz Band
In the 2.4 GHz band, channels are spaced 5 MHz apart, but each Wi-Fi channel is 20 MHz wide. This overlap can cause interference if adjacent channels are used. There are a limited number of nonoverlapping channels in this band:

Channels 1, 6, and 11: These are the three commonly used nonoverlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Using these channels helps to minimize interference.

Example:
- Channel 1: Center frequency 2.412 GHz
- Channel 6: Center frequency 2.437 GHz
- Channel 11: Center frequency 2.462 GHz

5 GHz Band
The 5 GHz band has more channels and less overlap due to the wider frequency range. The channels are typically 20 MHz wide, but can also be bonded to 40 MHz, 80 MHz, or 160 MHz channels for higher throughput. Nonoverlapping channels in the 5 GHz band depend on the width of the channels being used:

- 20 MHz Channels: There are many nonoverlapping channels available in the 5 GHz band. Some common ones are:
    - Channels: 36, 40, 44, 48 (U-NII-1)
    - Channels: 52, 56, 60, 64 (U-NII-2A, DFS channels)
    - Channels: 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140 (U-NII-2C, DFS channels)
    - Channels: 149, 153, 157, 161, 165 (U-NII-3)
- 40 MHz Channels: To avoid overlap, every second channel can be used.
    - Example: 36-40, 44-48
- 80 MHz Channels: Combine four adjacent 20 MHz channels.
    - Example: 36-48, 52-64, 100-112
- 160 MHz Channels: Combine eight adjacent 20 MHz channels.
    - Example: 36-64

6 GHz Band (Wi-Fi 6E)
The 6 GHz band is a new addition with Wi-Fi 6E, offering even more nonoverlapping channels. This band has a large amount of spectrum available, reducing the chances of interference significantly. Nonoverlapping channels here include:
- 20 MHz Channels: Numerous nonoverlapping channels are available.
- 40 MHz Channels: Similar approach to the 5 GHz band, every second channel.
- 80 MHz Channels: Multiple nonoverlapping channels.
- 160 MHz Channels: Many nonoverlapping channels due to the wide spectrum.

In the 2.4 GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are commonly used to avoid overlap. The 5 GHz band offers a larger selection of nonoverlapping channels, with more flexibility and higher bandwidth options. The new 6 GHz band introduced with Wi-Fi 6E provides even more channels, reducing interference further and enhancing overall network performance.

### 1.11.b SSID
Service Set Identifier (SSID) is a unique identifier that distinguishes one wireless network from another. 
- SSID is essentially the name of a wireless network. It is case-sensitive, alphanumeric string of up to 32 characters.
- Purpose is to differentiate between multiple wireless networks in a given area. It allows users to select the correct network to join. 

Types of Service Sets
1. Basic Service Set (BSS): This is the fundamental building block of an 802.11 wireless LAN. It consists of a single access point (AP) and all associated client devices. Each BSS has a unique identifier called the BSSID, which is typically the MAC address of the AP.
2. Extended Service Set (ESS): An ESS is a collection of two or more BSSs that share the same SSID. This allows for seamless roaming, as client devices can move between different APs within the same ESS without losing connectivity.

### 1.11.c RF
Radio Frequency (RF) refers to electromagnetic waves typically in the frequency range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz. These waves are used to transmit data through the air over various distances.

RF Principles
1. Electromagnetic Waves: RF communication relies on electromagnetic waves to carry information. These waves oscillate at specific frequencies and can travel through different media, including air, vacuum, and even some solid materials.
2. Frequency and Wavelength: The frequency of an RF wave is inversely realted to its wavelength. The choice of frequency affects the propagation characteristics of the signal.
3. Amplitude, Frequency, and Phase Modulation: Data can be encoded onto RF waves using different modulation techniques
    - Amplitude Modulation (AM): Varies the amplitude of the carrier wave
    - Frequency Modulation (FM): Varies the frequency of the carrier wave
    - Phase Modulation (PM): Varies the phase of the carrier wave
  
Key Components in RF Communication
1. Transmitter: Converts data into an RF signal and transmits it through an antenna.
2. Receiver: Captures the RF signal through an antenna and converts it back into data.
3. Antenna: Essential for both transmission and reception, antennas convert electrical signals into electromagnetic waves and vice versa.

RF Spectrum
- Frequency Bands: The RF spectrum is divided into various frequency bands, each designated for specific types of communication. Some common bands include:
    - Low Frequency (LF): 30 kHz to 300 kHz
    - Medium Frequency (MF): 300 kHz to 3 MHz
    - High Frequency (HF): 3 MHz to 30 MHz
    - Very High Frequency (VHF): 30 MHz to 300 MHz
    - Ultra High Frequency (UHF): 300 MHz to 3 GHz
    - Super High Frequency (SHF): 3 GHz to 30 GHz
    - Extremely High Frequency (EHF): 30 GHz to 300 GHz

### 1.11.d Encryption
Encryption is a critical security measure designed to protect data transmitted over wireless networks from unauthorized access and interception. 

Types of Wireless Encryption Protocols
1. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP):
    - Overview: An older encryption standard designed to provide wireless security comparable to wired networks.
    - Key Size: Typically uses 40-bit or 104-bit keys.

- AES-CCMP: Used in WPA2 and WPA3, it provides stronger security features including data confidentiality, authentication, and replay protection.

### 1.12 Explain virtualization fundamentals (server virtualization, containers, and VRFs)
Server Virtualization
- Server Virtualization involves dividing a physical server into multiple unique and isolated virtual servers using a software application called a hypervisor. Each virtual server runs its own operating system and applications as if it were a separate physical server.
    - Hypervisor - A software layer that enables virtualization, which sits between hardware and operating system.
    - Type 1 (Bare-Metal) - Runs directly on hardware (ex. VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V)
    - Type 2 (Hosted) - Runs on top of an existing operating system (ex. VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox)
    - Virtual Machines (VMs) - Instances of virtual servers that run on the hypervisor. Each VM has its own OS, applications, and virtual hardware resources.
        Use Cases:
      - Consolidating multiple servers onto fewer physical machines
      - Testing and development environments
      - Disaster recovery solutions

Containers
- Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies into a single unit that can run consistently across various computing environments. Unlike VMs, containers share the host operating system's kernel but isolate the application's processes.
    - Container Engine - Software that manages containers (ex. Docker)
    - Images - Read-only templates used to create containers. Contain everything needed to run an application.
    - Containers - Instances created from images. They run isolated processes with their own file system, network, and process space.
    - Orchestration - Tools like Kubernetes manage, scale, and deploy containers in a cluster
        Use Cases:
      - Microservices architectures
      - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines
      - Cloud-native applications

Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRFs)
- VRF is a technology that allows multiple instances of a routing table to coexist within the same router simultaneously. It enables the creation of multiple virtual networks over a single physical network infrastructure, each isolated from the others.
    - VRF Instances - Each VRF instance has its own routing table, enabling separate and isolated networks.
    - Route Distinguisher (RD) - A unique identifier that distinguishes routes in different VRF instances.
    - Route Target (RT) - Used for importing and exporting routes between VRF instances and ensuring proper routing.
        Use Cases:
      - Multi-tenant environments (ex. ISPs, data centers)
      - Separation of different departments or clients within an organization
      - Secure segmentation of networks for different applications or services


## 1.13 Describe switching concepts
### 1.13.a MAC learning and aging
MAC Learning 
- MAC learning is the process by which Ethernet swtiches dynamically build and update a table of MAC addresses and their associated ports.
    - Frame Reception - When a switch receives an Ethernet frame on a specific port, it examines the frame's source MAC address.
    - Updating the MAC Address Table
    - Forwarding Decision - If the destination MAC address is found, the switch forwards it to the corresponding port. If not found, the switch floods the frame to all ports except from the sender.

MAC Aging 
- MAC aging is the process by which entries in the MAC address table are automatically removed after a period of inactivity. It ensures that the MAC address table remains up-to-date and does not become filled with stale entries.
    - Age Timer - Each entry in the MAC address table has an associated age timer; it is reset every time a frame with the corresponding MAC address is received.
    - Aging Out - If an entry's age timer reaches a predefined threshold (typically 5 minutes by default), the entry is considered stale. The switch removes the stale entry from the table, freeing up sapce for new entries.

### 1.13.b Frame switching
- Frame Switching is a process used by network switches to direct data packets (frames) to their destination within a local area network (LAN). The switch makes forwarding decisions based on the MAC addresses in the frames.
    - MAC Address Table - forwarding table or CAM (Content Addressable Memory)
    - Switch Ports - Physical or virtual interfaces on a switch where devices connect to the network
    - Frame - A unit of data at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model
Process
1. Frame Reception - frame arrives at one of the switch ports.
2. MAC Learning - The switch will add new MAC addresses and updates the ports if a different one is labeled in the table.
3. Destination MAC address lookup - Switch checks the destination MAC address of the incoming frame against its MAC address table.
4. Forwarding Decision
   - Known Destination - Switch only forwards the frame only to the port associated with that MAC address.
   - Unknown Destination - The switch floods the frame to all ports except the one on which it was received. Known as unicast flood.
   - Broadcast Frame - If frame is broadcast, the switch floods it to all ports.
   - Multicast Frame - If frame is multicast, the switch floods it to all ports that are part of the multicast group.
5. Frame Transmission - The frame is transmitted out of the appropriate port(s) based on the forwarding decision. 

Transparent Bridging 
- Transparent Briding is a process in switching outlined by the IEEE where it is used to forward packets between network segments transparently, meaning the process is invisible to end devices. It is used in ethernet networks
Processes in IEEE 802.1d (MAC Bridge standard) are...
1. Learning - The switch records the source MAC address and port it arrived on to learn what devices are reachable.
2. Flooding - If MAC is found in table, bridge forwards to the corresponding port. If not, the bridge floods it out to all ports except the one it came in on to ensure frame reaches its destination.
3. Filtering - The switch will discard the frame when the switch receives a frame and the source and destination hosts reside on the same interface.
4. Forwarding - A switch forwards a frame when the destination address is in the switchâ€™s MAC address table and the source and destination are on different interfaces. 
5. Aging - MAC address table removes addresses after a certain amount of time from the latest time stamp when they are not used.

### 1.13.c Frame flooding
- Frame flooding is a mechanism used by network switches and bridges to handle frames with unknown destinations or special types of frames that need to be delivered to all devices on the network.
Key Scenarios
1. Unknown Unicast Frames - When the destination MAC address is not in the table, the switch floods all ports besides the sender. 
2. Broadcast Frames - The switch floods broadcast frames to all ports except the senders.
3. Multicast Frames - If the switch does not have specific multicast group information, it may flood multicast frames to ensure they reach all potential group members.

### 1.13.d MAC address table
- The MAC address table, also known as forwarding table or CAM (Content Addressable Memory), is used to map MAC addresses to specific switch ports, enabling efficient and accurate frame forwarding within a local area network (LAN).

- MAC Address: The unique identifier of a network device.
- Port: The switch port to which the device is connected.
- VLAN: The VLAN ID associated with the MAC address (if VLANs are used).
- Age: The remaining time before the entry expires and is removed from the table.

### Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

It defines characteristics like voltage levels, data rates, physical connectors, and transmission distances. Ex. Network Interface Cards (NICs), hubs, repeaters

Data Link Layer (Layer 2) - handles the reliable transmission of data frames between nodes on a network segment. It provides error detection and manages access to the physical medium and controls data flow. Ex. Switches, bridges

Network Layer (Layer 3) - responsible for routing packets across different networks to their destination based on logical address (IP addresses). It determines the optimal path for data transmission and handles addressing, routing, and traffic control. Ex. Routers, Layer 3 switches

Transport Layer (Layer 4) - ensures reliable and efficient data transfer between end systems. It breaks down large messages into smaller segments, manages acknowledgment and retransmission of lost data, and ensures data integrity. Ex. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Diagram Protocol)

Session Layer (Layer 5) - establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between applications on different devices. It handles syncronization, checkpointing, and recovery of data exchange sessions. Ex. Session establishment, maintenance, and termination. Ex. Session establishment, maintenance, and termination

Presentation Layer (Layer 6) - ensures that data is presented in a format that the application layer can understand. It handles data compression, encryption, and decryption to provide data security and privacy. Ex. Data encryption, compression, and format conversion

Application Layer (Layer 7) - provides network services directly to end-user applications. It supports communication services for applications like email, web browsing, file transfer, and remote access. Ex. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SSH
