# 1.0 Network Fundamentals
## 1.1 Explain the role and function of network components 
### 1.1a Routers
Routers facilitate communication between different networks. Routers connect networks, route data packets between them, enforce security policies, optimize traffic flow, and provide various other critical functions to ensure efficient and reliable communication across interconnected networks.
### 1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switches
Layer 2 switches primarily operate at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, focusing on MAC addresses and Ethernet frames. They are essential for LAN connectivity, MAC address learning, and VLAN support.

Layer 3 switches operate at both the Data Link layer (Layer 2) and the Network layer (Layer 3). They provide additional functionality such as IP routing, inter-VLAN routing, and support for routing protocols. Layer 3 switches are more versatile and suitable for larger networks requiring routing capabilities.
### 1.1.c Next-generation firewalls and IPS
Next-generation firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical for modern network security.

The function of a firewall is to protect some portion of a network. Techniques to do this include... access control lists (ACL), stateful packet inspection (SPI), and others. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) include all the functionality of a traditional firewall (ACL, SPI) and add support for built-in intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and virtual private networks (VPNs), as well as a much higher level of application awareness.

- Application Awareness & Control
- Integrated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- Advanced Threat Protection
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) Inspection: inspect encrypted traffic by decrypting SSL/TLS connections; protocol that allows computer systems to communicate safely over the internet
- User Identity Awarenes
- Content Filtering and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Threat Intelligence Integration

Content Filters
- Content Filters are used on some networks to control the type of data that is allowed to pass through the network. These devices can scan for and remove content that is not wanted. This functionality is typically built into modern firewalls and some routing platforms.

Intrusion Preventing System (IPS) is focused on detecting and preventing network threats in real-time. It is designed to monitor network traffic and take immediate action to block or mitigate malicious activity. 

Host Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (HIDS/HIPS)
HIDS/HIPS is used to protect a single host from an intrusion attempt. An IDS differs from an IPS in that an IDS only detects that someone is attacking; it doesn't mitigate the attack, whereas an IPS can actively mitigate the attack as it happens. 
- Modern versions of these types of software are focused mostly on intrusion prevention, because most modern-day attacks come with little or no warning and require an accelerated response.

Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (NIDS/NIPS)
NIDS/NIPS is different from a HIDS/HIPS system in that it detects or prevents attacks from happening against a group of devices. Similar to their host-based alternatives, NIDS detect attacks as they're happening and report the activity, and NIPS detect and actively take steps to prevent the attack from continuing. 
- Can include everything from dynamic creation of ACLS to shutting down offending ports

- Traffic Monitoring and Analysis
- Threat Detection and Prevention
- Signature-Based Detection
- Anomaly-Based Detection
- Protocol Analysis
- Integration with Security Ecosystem


NGFWs and IPS work together to provide layered security. NGFWs may handle application control, SSL inspection, and basic IPS functions, while dedicated IPS devices can provide deeper inspection and more granular control over network traffic.

### 1.1.d Access points
An access point (AP) is used in wireless Ethernet networks in place of an ethernet switch. Typical APs also provide bridging functionality between wired and wireless ethernet hosts. Access points (APs) enable devices to connect to a network wirelessly, providing mobility and flexibility for users usually in wireless local area networks (WLANs).

Three categories of access points include...
- Consumer APs ("Can be called wireless routers in your home")
    - Consumer APs have a WAN port for connection to an ISP (Internet Service Provider); this is another ethernet port separated in the device's configuration for routing between a local network and remote network (typically Internet). This is often used as a zone separator for the built-in firewall.
- Enterprise Automonous AP
    - Acts as a bridge between the wireless clients on a network and the wired network. These devices may be managed remotely, but the services delivered are all handled with the AP itself.
- Enterprise Lightweight AP
    - Bridges wireless and wired networks, but it is controlled by a remote controller. The lightweight AP is a brainless device without the wireless controller that controls its actions and configuration. The controller can perform load balancing between APs, interference detection and mitigation, and security functionality. 

- Wireless Connectivity to devices
- Network Extension: connect to wired network and provide signal to areas where cabling is impractical
- Client Mobility: Users can move around within the coverage area of multiple access points

    - Reliable: Provides error-checking, acknowledgement of data receipt, and retransmission of lost packets.
    - Handshaking: Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) for connection establishment
    - Example Applications: HTTP (web browsing) , FTP (file transfer), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol; email)
- UDP:
    - Connectionless: Does not establish a connection before sending data.
    - Unreliable: No guarantee of delivery, acknowledgement, or error-checking.
    - Fast Transmission: Minimal overhead, suitable for real-time applications.
    - Example Applications: DNS (Domain Name System), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), VoIP (Voice over IP), streaming media
 
2. Header Overhead
- TCP:
      - Header Size: Larger header (20 bytes min) due to additional fields like sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, window size, etc.
      - Overhead: Higher overhead compared to UDP
- UDP:
    - Header Size: Smaller header (8 bytes) with miminal fields (source port, destination port, length, checksum)
    - Efficiency: Lower overhead makes it faster and more efficient for transmitting small amounts of data
 
3. Reliability & Ordering
- TCP:
    - Reliability: Reliable delivery of data with error detection and correction mechanisms.
    - Sequencing: Ensures data is delivered in order to the application layer.
- UDP:
    - Reliability: No guarantee of delivery or error recovery
    - Ordering: Packets may arrive out of order, and the application layer must handle sequencing if needed.

4. Use Cases
- TCP:
    - Used when reliability and ordered delivery are crucial (Ex. file transfer, web browsing, email)
- UDP:
    - Used when speed and efficiency are more important than reliability (Ex. real-time multimedia applications, online games)
    - Suitable for applications that can tolerate occasional packet loss and do not require retransmission
 
5. Flow Control & Congestion Control
- TCP:
    - Implements flow control and congestion control algorithms to manage data transmission rates and avoid network congestion
    - Adjusts transmission speed based on network conditions (Ex. TCP sliding window)
- UDP:
    - Does not implement flow or congestion control
    - Applications using UDP must manage these aspects independently

6. Examples
- TCP: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, Telnet
- UDP: DNS, DHCP, SNMP, VoIP, streaming media (Ex. UDP-based protocols like RTP for real-time applications)
    - Another example of UDP is a keyboard or controller sending inputs to an online game. 

## 1.6 Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting
IPv4 Addresses are 32-bit numerical identifiers assigned to devices on a network. They are typically represented in dotted-decimal format (Ex. 192.168.1.1) and are divided into classes:
- Class A: Range from 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 (8 bits for network, 24 bits for host)
- Class B: Range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (16 bits for network, 16 bits for host)
- Class C: Range from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (24 bits for network, 8 bits for host)

Subnetting:
Subnetting involves dividing a larger network into smaller sub-networks (subnets). It helps optimize network performance, manage IP address allocation efficiently, and enhance security. 
1. Determine Requirements:
    - Network Size: Determine the number of subnets and hosts needed for each subnet.
    - IP Address Range: Choose an appropriate IP address range based on the required number of subnets and hosts per subnet.
2. Subnet Mask Calculation
    - Subnet Mask: Defines the network portion and host portion of an IP address.
    - CIDR Notation: Represents subnet masks using the format IP_address/Prefix_Length (Ex. 192.168.1.0/24)
3. IP Address Allocation
    - Assign IP Addressses: Allocate IP addresses to devices within each subnet
    - Reserve IP Addresses: Reserve certain IP addresses for network infrastructure (Ex. routers, servers)
4. Verify IP Address Configuration
    - IP Configuration Commands: Use command-line tools like 'ipconfig' (Windows) or 'ifconfig' (Linux/Unix) to verify IP addresses on devices
    - Subnet Mask Verification: Ensure that subnet masks match the intended network segmentation

## 1.7 Describe the need for private IPv4 addressing
1. Limited IPv4 Address Space
    - IPv4 Address Exhaustion: The IPv4 address space is limited to approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. With the exponential growth of devices connected to the internet, this address space is insufficient to provide a unique public IP address to every device.
    - Conversation of Public Addresses: Private IPv4 addresses help conserve the limited pool of public IPv4 addresses by allowing organizations to use the same private IP address ranges internally.
2. Private IPv4 Address Ranges:
Defined by RFC 1918, private IPv4 addresses are not routable on the public internet and are meant for use within private networks. The private IP address ranges are:
    - Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
    - Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.32.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
    - Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
3. Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Functionality: NAT allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet. When a device on a private network needs to communicate with a device on the public internet, NAT translates the private IP address to a public IP address.
- Types of NAT:
    - Static NAT: Maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address
    - Dynamic NAT: Maps a private IP address to a public IP address from a pool of available public addresses
    - Port Address Translation (PAT): Also known as "overloading", maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address by using different ports
4. Benefits of Private IPv4 Addressing:
- Security
    - Isolation: Devices with private IP addresses are not directly reachable from the public internet, providing an additional layer of security
    - Internal Communication: Private IP addresses facilitate secure communication within an organization's internal network
- Address Reusability
    - Local Use: Private IP address ranges can be reused in different private networks without conflict, making them ideal for internal communication
    - Cost Savings: Using private IP addresses reduces the need to purchase additional public IP addresses
- Simplified Network Management
    - Internal Organization: Easier management and organization of internal IP address schemes
    - Subnetting: Facilitates the creation of subnets within an organization, enhancing network performance and efficiency
5. Use Cases:
- Home Networks - use IP addresses to connect devices like computers, smartphones, and smart TVs to the router, which then uses NAT to connect to internet
- Corporate Networks - Businesses use private IP addresses to connect internal devices, servers, and workstations. NAT and firewall technologies help manage traffic between private network and the internet
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) - Private IP addresses are used within VPNs to provide secure, remote access to an organization's internal network resources
6. Comparison of Public & Private
- Public IP Addresses: Unique across the entire internet, assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or regional internet registries
- Private IP Addresses: Not unique across internet, used exclusively within private networks and not routable on the public internet

## 1.8 Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix
IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers represented in hexadecimal format. They are divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal deigits, separated by colons (Ex. 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). Leading zeros in each group can be omitted, and consecutive groups of zeros can be abbreviated with a double colon (::).

IPv6 Address Types (Prefix Examples)
- Global Unicast Address: Similar to public IPv4 addresses, these are globally unique and routable on the internet (Ex. 2001:0db8::/32)
- Link-Local Address: Used for communication within a single network segment (Ex. fe80::/10)
- Unique Local Address (ULA): Used for local communication within a site or organization, similar to private IPv4 addresses (Ex. fc00::/7)

Configuring IPv6 Addressing

1. Manual Configuration
You can manually assign IPv6 addresses to interfaces on network devices. Here's how to do it on a Cisco router:

## 1.9 Describe IPv6 address types
### 1.9.a Unicast (global, unique local, and link local)
1. Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs)
Global Unicast Addresses are unique IPv6 addresses that are routable on the global internet. They serve a similar purpose to public IPv4 addresses and are used for direct communication between devices across different networks worldwide.

Structure:
- Prefix: The global unicast address typically starts with '2000::/3' (the first three bits are '001')
- Global Routing Prefix: The initial portion of the address assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) or regional registries (Ex. 2001:0db8::/32)
- Subnet ID: Defines a specific subnet within the given network (Ex. 2001:0db8:abcd::/64)
- Interface ID: The remaining portion of the address, often derived from the device's MAC address using EUI-64 format or generated randomly
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/11f5550c-15ce-4fdb-8276-2e3ff3c0f64e">

Use Cases:
- Public servers and devices that need to be accessible over the internet
- Communication between different networks across the internet

2. Unique Local Addresses (ULAs)
Unique Local Addresses in IPv6 are meant for local communication within a site or organization, similar to private IPv4 addresses. They are not routable on the global internet and are used primarily for internal networks.

Structure:
- Prefix: ULAs start with 'fc00::/7', but typically use 'fd00::/8' (the eighth bit is '1').
- Global ID: A 40-bit identifier that ensures uniqueness within an organization
- Subnet ID: Defines specific subnets within the local network
- Interface ID: The remaining portion of the address
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/07b78db1-c51f-42cd-b11a-9012310d4d9e">

Use Cases:
- Internal communications within an organization or site
- Networks that do not require external internet access
- Virtual private networks (VPNs)

3. Link-Local Addresses
Link-local addresses are used for communication within a single network segment or link. They are automatically configured on all IPv6-enabled interfaces and are essential for various network functions like neighbor discovery.

Structure:
- Prefix: Link-local addresses start with 'fe80::/10' (the first ten bits are '1111 1110 10')
- Remaining Bits: Set to zero, except for the Interface ID, which is typically derived from the device's MAC address
<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/58486c34-2045-4e1d-a98a-5f08a0a28266">

Use Cases:
- Communication between devices on the same local network segment
- Essential for network discovery protocols, such as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
- Required for the operations of certain network features, like auto-configuration

Key Differences and Usage:
- Global Unicast Addresses: Used for devices needing global reachability on the internet. They are unique across the globe and routable.
- Unique Local Addresses: Used within private networks for internal communication. They are not routable on the global internet but unique within a given local scope.
- Link-Local Addresses: Used for communication within a single network segment. They are automatically assigned and essential for basic network operations.

<img width="732" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gober9/CCNA/assets/172049706/dffb0021-1ceb-4dd4-8abd-39e0960c2332">

### 1.9.b Anycast
Anycast addresses in IPv6 are used to deliver packets to the nearest or most convenient node among a group of potential receivers that share the same address. This is useful for load balancing, redundancy, and optimizing service delivery.

Characteristics:
1. One-to-Nearest Communication - The nearest node is typically determined by the routing protocol based on metrics like hop count, latency, or other criteria.
2. Shared Address - Multiple nodes can share the same anycast address. When a packet is sent to an anycast address, it is delivered to the closest node.
3. Routing-Based Delivery - Routing protocols ensure that the packet is delivered to the nearest node in terms of routing cost.

Use Cases:
- DNS Servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other services where availability and redundancy are critical

### 1.9.c Multicast
IPv6 Multicast is a method of sending network traffic to multiple destinations simultaneously. Multicast sends data only to a group of interested receivers. This is useful for applications like streaming media, video conferencing, and other types of group communication.

Characteristics:
1. Multicast Addresses:
    - Start with the prefix 'FF00::/8'. The structure of a multicast address is defined as 'FFxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx', where the first 8 bits are always '1111 1111' to indicate it's a multicast address.
    - Next 4 bits are the "flags" field, and following 4 bits indicate the scope (Ex. link-local, site-local, organization-local, global)
    - Examples of common scopes:
        - FF01:: for node-local scope
        - FF02:: for link-local scope
        - FF05:: for site-local scope
        - FF08:: for organization-local scope
        - FF0E:: for global scope
2. Multicast Groups:
    - A multicast group is a set of receivers that are interested in receiving specific data streams. Devices can join or leave multicast groups dynamically.
    - IPv6 uses the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) to manage membership in multicast groups.
3. Efficient Data Distribution:
    - Multicast is more efficient because data packets are only sent to nodes that are part of the multicast group. This conserves bandwidth and reduces network load.
4. Uses of Multicast:
    - Common applications include live video or audio streaming, IPTV, online gaming, stock ticker services, and real-time data feeds.
### 1.9.d Modified EUI 64
Modified EUI-64 is a method used to create a unique interface identifier (IID) for an IPv6 address based on a device's MAC address. This method ensures that the IID, which forms the last 64 bits of an IPv6 address, is globally unique.

Modified EUI 64 Format
1. Start with the 48-bit MAC Address
    - A MAC address is typically represented as six pairs of hexdecimal digits (Ex. '00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E')
2. Split the MAC Address
    - Divide the MAC address into two 24-bit halves: '00:1A:2B' and '3C:4D:5E'.
3. Insert the FFFE Hexadecimal Sequence:
    - Insert 'FF:FE' in the middle of the MAC address. This makes the address 64 bits long:
        - '00:1A:2B' becomes '00:1A:2B:FF:FE:3C:4D:5E'
4. Modify the Universal/Local (U/L) Bit:
    - The 7th bit of the first byte in the MAC address is known as the U/L bit. This bit indicates whether the address is universally or locally administered.
    - In the MAC address '00:1A:2B:FF:FE:3C:4D:5E', the first byte 00 in binary is 00000000.
    - Change the 7th bit (the U/L bit) from 0 to 1 to indicate that the address is globally unique. This transforms 00000000 to 00000010, which is 02 in hexadecimal.
    - The final IID is 02:1A:2B:FF:FE:3C:4D:5E.
