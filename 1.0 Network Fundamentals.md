# 1.0 Network Fundamentals
## 1.1 Explain the role and function of network components 
### 1.1a Routers
Routers facilitate communication between different networks. Routers connect networks, route data packets between them, enforce security policies, optimize traffic flow, and provide various other critical functions to ensure efficient and reliable communication across interconnected networks.
### 1.1.b Layer 2 and Layer 3 Switches
Layer 2 switches primarily operate at the Data Link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, focusing on MAC addresses and Ethernet frames. They are essential for LAN connectivity, MAC address learning, and VLAN support.

Layer 3 switches operate at both the Data Link layer (Layer 2) and the Network layer (Layer 3). They provide additional functionality such as IP routing, inter-VLAN routing, and support for routing protocols. Layer 3 switches are more versatile and suitable for larger networks requiring routing capabilities.
### 1.1.c Next-generation firewalls and IPS
Next-generation firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical for modern network security.

Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) combine traditional firewall capabilities with more sophisticated detection and prevention technologies to address a broader range of security threats. 


- Application Awareness & Control: identify and control applications regardless of port, protocol, or encryption method
- Integrated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): built-in IPS functionality to detect and prevent network threats
- Advanced Threat Protection: offers advanced protection features like sandboxing, which allows suspicious files to be executed in a controlled environment to observe their behavior and detect advanced malware and zero-day exploits.
- SSL/TLS Inspection: inspect encrypted traffic by decrypting SSL/TLS connections.
- User Identity Awareness: enforce policies based on user identity rather than just IP addresses.
- Content Filtering and Data Loss Prevention (DLP): filer web content and prevent access to malicious or inappropriate websites.
- Threat Intelligence Integration: integrate with threat intelligence services to receive real-time updates on emerging threats, ensuring that the firewall can recognize and block the latest attack methods.


Intrusion Preventing System (IPS) is focused on detecting and preventing network threats in real-time. It is designed to monitor network traffic and take immediate action to block or mitigate malicious activity. 


- Traffic Monitoring and Analysis: continuously monitors network traffic for signs of malicious activity.
- Threat Detection and Prevention: take various actions such as dropping malicious packets, blocking traffic from specific IP addresses, resetting connections, or alerting network administrators.
- Signature-Based Detection: relies on a database of known attack signatures to detect threats.
- Anomaly-Based Detection: can detect unusual patterns in network traffic that may indicate a new or unknown attack.
- Protocol Analysis: can analyze network protocols to ensure they conform to expected behavior.
- Integration with Security Ecosystem: can integrate with other security devices and systems, such as firewalls, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, and endpoint protection solutions, to provide a coordinated response to threats.


NGFWs and IPS work together to provide layered security. NGFWs may handle application control, SSL inspection, and basic IPS functions, while dedicated IPS devices can provide deeper inspection and more granular control over network traffic.
